A novel artificial intelligence (AI) framework that integrates machine learning with Genetic Algorithms (GAs) is introduced to accelerate the design of solid propellant. Through high-throughput screening using this framework, seven promising ECs were identified from over 1,000 candidates, with the potential to increase the specific impulse (Isp) to 278 s and to enhance the range by up to 45%.

The training and test sets are described in the article 'Supplementary Data 1.csv'

Among them, the number of training sets is 398129, and the number of test sets is 44094
