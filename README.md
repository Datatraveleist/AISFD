# Machine Learning-Driven Discovery of High Performance Solid Propellants

A novel artificial intelligence (AI) framework that integrates machine learning (ML) with Genetic Algorithms (GAs) is introduced to accelerate the design of solid propellants. This framework utilizes high-throughput screening to identify promising energetic compounds (ECs) and optimize their formulations, significantly enhancing propellant performance. Through this approach, seven promising ECs were identified from over 1,000 candidates, with the potential to increase the specific impulse (Isp) to 278 s and enhance the range by up to 45%.
